    <span class = paragraphTitle>So why do I want a second chance?</span>
    <p>Back in 2009 I made the mistake of going to college without knowing what it was that I wanted to do, I thought I would figure this out as life went on. 
        I took classes that I enjoyed, sure, and I did learn more about myself and what I am capable of but I never had a good idea as to what I wanted to do when I got out of school.
        I graduated from WCU on Dec. 13th 2014 with a BA in Art... Yes I wanted to be an artist, but it is not easy to live as an artist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = myStory>
    <p> After graduating I needed a job, something to pay the bills and live on. I got a minimum wage job at a fast food restaurant. 
        This was supposed to be temporary however I was promoted to management within months. The longer I spent working in this restaurant, the more I was emotionally invested in the people I work with, especially my boss. 
        I have worked there for five years now, it's not something I wanted to make a career out of but it is what I had settled into.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = myStory>
        <span class = paragraphTitle>So why the sudden change? Why now?</span>
    <p>I have always had family and friends telling me I needed to get out of this restuarant, that it doesn't pay well, the hours are too long. ect. 
        My goals have shifted over the years and sometimes it just takes the right person to help me find my motiviation to move on. I started dating someone who is a software engineer. 
        I was curious about what he does for a living, he has shown me some things and eventually he suggested that I should apply for Lambda school. 
        This was not a simple decision, emotionally taxing; but he is right I have to make a change and I am hoping Lambda school could be that second chance for me.</p>
  </div>
  <div id = myFuture>
      <span>What have I learned so far as I am wrapping up the Lambda school precourse?</span>
     <ul>
      <li>It is challenging as this is all new to me, but not impossible.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the challange of learning something new.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the problem solving aspect and I am eager to learn more.</li>
     </ul> 
    <span>I was also pretty proud of this</span>
